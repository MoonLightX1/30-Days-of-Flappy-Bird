## Video 🎥

Available when the video is posted.

## Why? ❓

Since of all the clones of Flappy Bird and with its rapid success it would be neat to spend thirty days posting daily uploads of my development of making 30 different variations of Flappy Bird. What would each look like? What would the gameplay be like? That's all questions I had and I wanted to experiment and test it out.

## How to run 🖥️

Available when the challenge is completed.
